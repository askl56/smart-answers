* Interpolation of choice fields uses the key not the value, ie * united-kingdom - United Kingdom will produce 'united-kingdom' when interpolated.
* Helper method to detect if a country is the commonwealth.
* Commonwealth countries are different in different calculators.
* Country select: it would be nice to have except / only
* Exception notification / error messages like "Parse Error" are not very helpful ie. 'other' instead of 'otherwise'
* If matching a predecate it doesnt continue if a conclusion cant be found within the current conditional

Basically I expected

* married_at_time_of_birth is 'yes'
  * person_combination is 'father' => childs_date_of_birth
  * country_of_birth is 'sweden' => childs_date_of_birth
  * otherwise => where_are_you_now
* otherwise => where_are_you_now

To be functionally the same as

* married_at_time_of_birth is 'yes'
  * person_combination is 'father' => childs_date_of_birth
  * country_of_birth is 'sweden' => childs_date_of_birth
* otherwise => where_are_you_now
