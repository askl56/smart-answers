Things that would improve the process 

1) Nested outcomes (like snippets) for better organisation

2) We'd like to be able to use smartdown plugins to evaluate next node rules that can take arugments like.

* passport_type(country_user_located) in {ips_application_1 ips_application_2 ips_application_3} => question_2

Right now we have to do

* ips_application?(country_user_located) => question_2

It would also be nice to be able to push predicates into state, then we could call passport_type and have it return (as if the user had answered a question)

3) Would be very nice to have access to users answers within 

module SmartdownPlugins
  module OverseasPassports

Otherwise we're passing around current_location to almost all the functions, all the time.
