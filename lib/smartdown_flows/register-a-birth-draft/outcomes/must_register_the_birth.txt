You must register the birth according to the regulations in %{country_of_birth}.
You can’t register your child’s birth with the UK authorities abroad. This is because unmarried fathers can’t pass on British nationality to a child born before 1 July 2006.

You may still be able to apply for British citizenship for the child.

You may also be able to register the birth if you’ve married the other parent since the child was born. Contact your local British embassy to find out.
