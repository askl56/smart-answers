# Register a birth abroad

You must register your child’s birth according to the regulations in the country where the child was born. They’ll give you a local birth certificate.

This local birth certificate should be accepted in the UK, eg when you apply for a passport or register with a school or doctor. You might need to have it [translated and certified](/certifying-a-document) if it’s not in English.

Once you’ve registered locally you may also be able to register the birth with the UK authorities. You don’t need to do this but it means:

* the birth will be recorded with the General Register Offices or at the National Records Office of Scotland
* you can order a consular birth registration certificate

^ You can still [apply for a UK passport for your child](/apply-renew-passport) even if you don’t register the birth in the UK.
