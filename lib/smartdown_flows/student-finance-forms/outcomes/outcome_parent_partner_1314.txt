# Parents and partners - forms

Some student finance (eg a Maintenance Grant) is based on income.

You must send your income details for the 2011 to 2012 tax year. Do this using form PFF2.

If you think your income has dropped by 15% or more since the 2011 to 2012 tax year youâ€™ll need to do both of the following:

+ submit your 2011 to 2012 income details using form PFF2
+ complete a CYI form (to ask for the student finance to be based on your expected 2013 to 2014 tax year income)
