## How long it takes

Your application will take **at least** %{waiting_time(passport_country application_action)} weeks from when it’s received by Her Majesty's Passport Office in the UK.

Applications may take longer if:

- HM Passport Office need to ask you for more information or documents
- the photographs you send are rejected

Don’t book any travel until you have a valid passport. If you need to travel more urgently, apply for an [Emergency Travel Document](/emergency-travel-document).
