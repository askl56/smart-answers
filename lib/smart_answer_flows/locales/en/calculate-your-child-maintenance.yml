        description: Work out the amount of child maintenance if you’re arranging it yourselves, or to get an idea of the statutory amounts from the Child Support Agency or Child Maintenance Service
      title: Child maintenance calculator
      body: |
        Use the calculator to agree on a child maintenance amount if [you’re arranging it yourselves](/arranging-child-maintenance-yourself), or to get an idea of the statutory amount the government would work out for you (including collection and application fees).

        Don't use the calculator if you have a ['1993 scheme' or '2003 scheme' case](/how-child-maintenance-is-worked-out/child-maintenance-before-march-2003). These are managed by the Child Support Agency (CSA).

        ##What you need to know:##

        - the calculator gives an estimate (it won't cover variations for exceptional circumstances)
        - you need information about your income
        - if you already have a case with the Child Support Agency (CSA) or the Child Maintenance Service and your circumstances have changed, [contact the office managing your case](/child-support-agency) - they’ll tell you if your child maintenance payments will change

        Check the [child maintenance rates](/how-child-maintenance-is-worked-out/how-the-child-maintenance-service-works-out-child-maintenance) before you use the calculator.
