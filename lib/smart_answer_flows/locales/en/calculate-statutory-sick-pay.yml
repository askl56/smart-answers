        ##What you need to know

        You’re only responsible for paying SSP if:

        - you pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions for your employee (or would do if not for their age or their level of earnings)
        - your employee was sick for 4 or more days in a row (including non-working days)
        - your employee has told you they’re sick within your own time limit (or 7 days if you don’t have one)

        ^ You can’t use the calculator for periods of sickness before 6 April 2011.^

      # Answer 8
      maximum_entitlement_reached:
        body: |
          Your employee isn’t entitled to Statutory Sick Pay because they’ve already received the maximum amount of SSP (28 weeks).

          You must send them [form SSP1](/employers-sick-pay/eligibility-and-form-ssp1) within 7 days of them going off sick. They may be able to get [Employment Support Allowance (ESA)](/employment-support-allowance).
