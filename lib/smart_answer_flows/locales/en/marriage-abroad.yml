          ##What you need to do

          You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

          You can normally get a CNI by giving a notice of marriage at your local register office or registrar in the UK. Find your local office or registrar in [England and Wales](https://www.gov.uk/register-offices), [Scotland](http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files1/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm), [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us).

          ^A CNI issued in Scotland is valid for 3 months. A CNI issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland will not expire. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. You should also check with the local authorities in %{country_name_lowercase_prefix} to find out how long a CNI is valid under local law.^

          ###Legalisation and translation

          You might need to exchange your UK-issued CNI for one that’s valid in %{country_name_lowercase_prefix} at the nearest embassy or consulate to where you’re getting married.

          You should also check if it needs to be:

          - ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine)
          - translated - [find a translator abroad](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers), or in the UK through the [Institute of Linguists](http://www.iol.org.uk/linguist/translator1.asp?r=PCTXYL10046)

          You should also check with the local authorities in %{country_name_lowercase_prefix} to find out if you need to provide legalised and translated copies of any other documents.

          ^Your partner will need to follow the same process and pay the fees to get their own CNI.^

          %The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

        kosovo_local_resident: |
          Contact the relevant local authorities in Kosovo to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

          ^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

          ##What you need to do

          You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

          If you need a CNI, you must give notice of your intended marriage in %{country_name_lowercase_prefix}. You must do this at the British embassy or in front of a notary public in that country.

          [Make an appointment at the embassy in Pristina](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco#!/british-embassy-pristina/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker).

          You need to have been living in %{country_name_lowercase_prefix} for 3 full days before you can post notice, eg if you arrive in the country on Thursday, the earliest you can post notice is the following Monday.

          You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:


          - your passport
          - your [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) or [naturalisation certificate](/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate)
          - proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the embassy to find out what you need
          - equivalent documents for your partner

          If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

          - a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
          - a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
          - your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

          You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English.

          The embassy will provide you with forms for your notice of marriage, and an oath or affidavit (written statement of facts) stating that you’re free to marry. You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

          [Download ‘Affidavit for marriage’](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form)
          $D

          ##What happens next

          The embassy will charge a fee for taking the oath, and then display your notice of marriage publicly for a further 7 days. They’ll then issue the CNI, as long as nobody has registered an objection. There’s an additional fee for this.

          %The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

          You should check if your CNI needs to be legalised (certified as genuine) by the local authorities in Kosovo.

          ##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

          Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.

        monaco_marriage: |

          Contact the relevant local authorities to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

          There isn’t a British Embassy in Monaco. Contact the [British Embassy in Paris](/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-paris) for help with getting married in Monaco.

          If you’re not in Monaco, [your closest Monegasque embassy](http://en.gouv.mc/Policy-Practice/Monaco-Worldwide/Diplomacy-and-International-Presence/bilateral-relations/All-the-countries) may be able to give you advice, or give you the contact details of the relevant local authorities.

          ^You should get legal advice before making any plans.^

          ##What you need to do

          You may be asked to provide a certificate of custom law (‘certificat de coutume’) if you’re getting married in Monaco. You can get one of these from the [British Embassy in Paris](/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-paris).

          You should check with the relevant local authorities in the town where you’re getting married to find out if you need one. Either you or your partner will need to have been resident there for 40 days before the ceremony.

          Some local authorities only issue a certificate of custom law less than 6 months before the date of marriage. You should check with them before you apply. If your certificate is refused because you applied too early, you will need to apply and pay again.

          ^You’ll need to have a civil ceremony first if you’re getting married in a religious ceremony.^

          ###Applying for a certificate of custom law from the British Embassy

          s2. Make sure you’ve got all of the supporting documents you need - there’s a checklist on the form.
          s3. You’ll need to include a pre-paid self-addressed envelope and a registered letter slip (‘récépissé d’un envoi recommandé sans avis de réception’) with your name and address, or a €6.55 postage fee, if you want your documents to be returned.
          s4. Send your completed form to the British Embassy with your supporting documents and the correct fee. You’ll have to pay in Euros, as instructed on the payment slip attached to the form.

          s5. The embassy will send your certificate and return your documents between 5 and 7 days after receiving your application.


          ###The certificate of celibacy

          The local authority might also ask you for a certificate of celibacy (‘certificat de célibat’) to prove you’re not married or in a civil partnership. There’s no equivalent to this document in British law, so you’ll need to download the official note which explains this and take it with you instead.

          Contact the local town hall (‘mairie’) where you’re getting married to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

          If you’re not in France, [your closest French embassy](http://www.mfe.org/index.php/Annuaires/Ambassades-et-consulats-francais-a-l-etranger) may also be able to give you advice, or put you in touch with the relevant local authorities if you don’t know who to contact.

          ^You should [get legal advice](/government/publications/france-list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

          ##What you need to do

          You may be asked to provide a certificate of custom law (‘certificat de coutume’) if you’re getting married in %{country_name_lowercase_prefix}.

          You should check with the mairie in the town where you’re getting married to find out if you need one. Either you or your partner will need to have been legally resident there for at least 40 days before the ceremony.

          ^You’ll need to have a civil ceremony first if you’re getting married in a religious ceremony.^

          If you need a certificate of custom law, you can get one from the [British Embassy in Paris](/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-paris).

          Some mairies only accept a certificate of custom dated less than 6 months before the date of marriage. You should check with them before you apply. If your certificate is refused because you applied too early, you will need to apply and pay again.

          ###Applying for a certificate of custom law from the British Embassy

          s1. Download the [certificate of custom law application form](/government/publications/application-for-a-certificate-of-custom-law-for-marriage-france).
          s2. Make sure you’ve got all of the supporting documents you need - there’s a checklist on the form.
          s3. You’ll need to include a pre-paid self-addressed envelope and a registered letter slip (‘récépissé d’un envoi recommandé sans avis de réception’) with your name and address, or a €6.55 postage fee, if you want your documents to be returned.
          s4. Send your completed form to the British Embassy with your supporting documents and the correct fee. You’ll have to pay in Euros, as instructed on the payment slip attached to the form. See fee 11 on [consular fees for France](/government/publications/france-consular-fees) for the current cost.
          s5. The embassy will send your certificate and return your documents between 5 and 7 days after receiving your application.


          ###The certificate of celibacy

          The mairie might also ask you for a certificate of celibacy (‘certificat de célibat’) to prove you’re not married or in a civil partnership. There’s no equivalent to this document in British law, so you’ll need to download the official note which explains this and take it to the mairie instead.

          ##Naturalisation of your foreign partner if they move to the UK

          If your partner isn’t British, they can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
