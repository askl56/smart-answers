Contact the [Embassy of the Republic of Kosovo in London](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for <%= country_name_lowercase_prefix %>](/foreign-travel-advice/<%= ceremony_country %>) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

You can normally get a CNI by giving a notice of marriage at your local register office or registrar in the UK. Find your local office or registrar in [England and Wales](/register-offices), [Scotland](http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/files1/registration/reglist.pdf) or [Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm).

^A CNI issued in Scotland is valid for 3 months. A CNI issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland will not expire, but you should check with the local authorities in the country where you intend to marry to find out how long a CNI is valid under local law.^

###Legalisation and translation

You might need to exchange your UK-issued CNI for one that’s valid in <%= country_name_lowercase_prefix %> at the nearest embassy or consulate to where you’re getting married.

You should also check if it needs to be:

- ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine)
- translated - [find a translator abroad](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers), or in the UK through the [Institute of Linguists](http://www.iol.org.uk/linguist/translator1.asp?r=PCTXYL10046)

You should also check with the local authorities in <%= country_name_lowercase_prefix %> to find out if you need to provide legalised and translated copies of any other documents.

^Your partner will need to follow the same process and pay the fees to get their own CNI.^

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

##What you need to do

You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

If you need a CNI, you must give notice of your intended marriage in <%= country_name_lowercase_prefix %>. You must do this at a British embassy or in front of a notary public in that country.

<%= render partial: '../data_partials/overseas_passports_embassies.erb', locals: { overseas_passports_embassies: overseas_passports_embassies } -%>

You need to have been living in <%= country_name_lowercase_prefix %> for 3 full days before you can post notice, eg if you arrive in the country on Thursday, the earliest you can post notice is the following Monday.

You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:


- your passport
- your [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) or [naturalisation certificate](/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate)
- proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the embassy to find out what you need
- equivalent documents for your partner

If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) if it’s not in English.

The embassy will provide you with forms for your notice of marriage, and an oath or affidavit (written statement of facts) stating that you’re free to marry. You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

##What happens next

The embassy will charge a fee for taking the oath, and then display your notice of marriage publicly for a further 7 days. They’ll then issue the CNI, as long as nobody has registered an objection. There’s an additional fee for this.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

You should check if your CNI needs to be legalised (certified as genuine) by the local authorities in Kosovo.

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
