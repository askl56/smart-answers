###Other requirements for Cyprus

You must provide evidence that you’re allowed to marry if you’re resident in Cyprus but you’ve been there for less than 3 years. However, the [General Register Office](http://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/) (GRO) in the UK can only provide letters covering a specified 3-year period, not including the most recent 18 months.

You should [contact the municipality](http://www.ucm.org.cy/Account_List.aspx) in the area of Cyprus where you’d like to marry to check if they’ll accept this.
